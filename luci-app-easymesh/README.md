# **üõ†Ô∏è How to Setup a Basic Mesh Network (1 Server + 2 Nodes)**  

### **Step 1: Setup the Mesh Server**
1. **Disable/Delete any active wireless networks** in OpenWRT (Go to `Network ‚Üí Wireless`).  
2. **Go to `Network ‚Üí EasyMesh`**  
3. Select **"Server"** for Mesh Mode.
   ![EasyMesh Screenshot](https://github.com/torguardvpn/luci-app-easymesh/blob/main/images/1740359288453.png)
5. **Enter your WiFi SSID** (This is the main WiFi network all devices will connect to).  
6. **Select the WiFi Radio** for the **regular AP**. *(Recommended: Use a different radio than the mesh backhaul for best performance.)*  
7. **Select the Mesh Radio** and enter a separate SSID. *(The app will automatically append `-mesh` to your mesh SSID.)*
   ![EasyMesh Screenshot](https://github.com/torguardvpn/luci-app-easymesh/raw/main/images/1740359253028.png)
9. **Enable Password Protection**, enter a Mesh Password, and click **Save & Apply**.  
10. Click **"Reapply EasyMesh Settings"** to deploy the APs and activate mesh networking.  

üîπ **Verify Setup:**  
- **Go to `Network ‚Üí Wireless`** to check that the WiFi networks were added.
  ![EasyMesh Screenshot](https://github.com/torguardvpn/luci-app-easymesh/blob/main/images/1740359342226.png)
- **Go to `Network ‚Üí Interfaces`** to confirm that the Batman (`bat0`) device and (`mesh_batman`) interface was added.

# **‚ùì FAQ (Common Questions & Issues)**  

### **Do I have to use WireGuard with this app?**  
**No.** You can deploy a standard Mesh WiFi network on an OpenWRT router **without a VPN** in minutes.  

### **Can I run both the main WiFi AP and Mesh AP on the same radio?**  
You can, **but it‚Äôs not recommended**.  
For best performance, use **separate radios** for each network.  
- **If running both on the same radio:**  
  - **Limitations:** Limited channels reduce performance.  
  - **Disable Batman Advanced features:** Disable **bonding** and **fragmentation** to reduce overhead.  

### **Can I add wired devices or a router that doesn‚Äôt support mesh?**  
Yes. If using a **wired OpenWRT router (x86 device) without mesh support**:  
- **Go to `Network ‚Üí Interfaces` and manually select `bat0` as the device on the `mesh_batman` interface.**  

### **How do I recover a node after enabling Dumb AP mode?**  
- If you can't access it via Wifi connect it to your server **via LAN cable**, then find the node IP under DHCP and connect in a web browser.  

### **Best way to change Mesh WiFi settings?**  
1. **Change settings on each node first.**  
2. **Update settings on the Mesh Server last.**  
3. **Reapply settings** to reconnect all nodes.
